# Data Pipeline with Apache Airflow, Snowflake, and dbt

## Overview  
This project demonstrates how to build a **data pipeline** using **Apache Airflow**, **dbt (Data Build Tool)**, and **Snowflake**. The pipeline automates data transformation tasks, allowing seamless integration between Airflow (workflow orchestration), dbt (data transformation), and Snowflake (data storage and processing).  

## Why This Project?  

- **Automate Data Workflows**: Instead of manually running SQL queries, the pipeline schedules and automates everything.  
- **Improve Data Quality**: dbt ensures transformations are structured, tested, and version-controlled.  
- **Centralized Data Processing**: Snowflake acts as a powerful data warehouse where all transformations happen efficiently.  
- **Scalability & Performance**: The setup allows organizations to process large amounts of data with **minimal manual intervention**.

## What I Did in This Project  

### 1. Set Up Apache Airflow with Astro CLI  
- Used **Astro CLI** to create an **Airflow project** and run it inside Docker.  
- Configured Airflow to manage dbt models using **Airflow DAGs** (Directed Acyclic Graphs).  

### 2. Created a dbt Project for Data Transformation  
- Set up a **dbt project** within Airflow’s DAGs folder.  
- Defined **dbt models** to transform data in Snowflake.  
- Wrote **SQL-based transformations** in dbt.  

### 3. Connected Airflow to Snowflake  
- Configured **Airflow Connections** to securely connect to **Snowflake** using a **username and password**.  
- Verified **database, schema, role, and warehouse settings** for proper access control.  

### 4. Built and Scheduled Airflow DAGs  
- Created an **Airflow DAG** to run dbt models on a **daily schedule**.  
- Defined **dependencies** between different transformation tasks.  
- Scheduled **automatic execution** of the pipeline.  

### 5. Ran and Debugged the Pipeline  
- **Triggered DAG runs** in Airflow to process data in Snowflake.  
- Fixed **connection issues, database permissions, and schema mismatches**.  
- Ensured **successful dbt transformations** were running on a schedule.

## How the Pipeline Works  

1️ **Airflow DAG gets triggered** (either manually or on a schedule).  
2️ The **DAG executes dbt commands** (such as `dbt run` or `dbt test`) to transform data.  
3️ dbt **reads raw data from Snowflake**, applies transformations, and stores the processed data back into Snowflake.  
4️ The final transformed data **is ready for analysis and reporting** in Snowflake.

## Possible Use Cases  

### 1. Automating ETL Processes  
- Instead of manually extracting, transforming, and loading data, this pipeline **automates** everything.  
- Useful for **finance, sales, marketing, or healthcare** data pipelines.  

### 2. Data Warehousing & Analytics  
- Businesses can use this setup to **aggregate data from multiple sources** into Snowflake.  
- Data scientists can **query pre-processed data** instead of working with raw datasets.  

### 3. Scheduled Reporting & Dashboards  
- The pipeline ensures **daily updates to transformed data**, making it useful for **BI dashboards** (Tableau, Power BI).  
- **Example**: A company can schedule **daily sales reports** with fresh, cleaned data.  

### 4. Machine Learning Data Preparation  
- Data engineers can use this pipeline to **clean and structure data** before passing it to ML models.  
- Ensures **consistent, high-quality data** for AI/ML applications.

## Future Improvements  
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automate deployment of dbt models using **GitHub Actions** or **Jenkins**.  
- **More Data Sources**: Extend the pipeline to include **streaming data sources** (Kafka, AWS Kinesis).  
- **Advanced dbt Models**: Add **incremental data processing** for handling **large datasets efficiently**.

## Conclusion  
This project **successfully integrates Apache Airflow, dbt, and Snowflake** to build an **automated, scalable, and reliable** data pipeline. It simplifies **data transformation**, improves **workflow automation**, and ensures **clean and structured data** for analytics and reporting.
